# Conversation
A basic Scratch program that displays a conversation. Created in the latter half of 2012 as an assignment from my 9th grade computer science class.

The program criteria involved two characters holding a conversation with eachother. The characters also needed more than one costume, and there also needed to be more than one background.

This program requires Scratch to be properly ran.
